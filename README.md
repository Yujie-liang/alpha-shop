An online shop, developed with `React framework` and `Sass/Scss`. The main focus of the project is in the use of `React` to build reusable components for better maintenance. `useState` was used to build the interactive web. Responsive web design (RWD) was used to better display the website on different screen sizes (focused on desktop and pad in this project) Register, login, and other database operation functions were implemented by api integration.
